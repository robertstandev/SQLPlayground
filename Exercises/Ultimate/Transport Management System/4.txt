Functions:
FetchUnassignedRoutes: Returns routes a fleet vehicle is not currently allocated to.

CalculateFuelConsumption: Computes the fuel consumption based on distance traveled.

DescribeFleetVehicle: Concatenates category and plate number to return a full description of a fleet vehicle.

ListRoutesByDriver: Returns routes assigned to a specific driver.

ListAssignedRoutes: Returns routes a fleet vehicle is assigned to.

Apply CASE: Incorporate a CASE statement in one of the functions, e.g., in CalculateFuelConsumption, use CASE to assess the fuel efficiency levels and categorize it.

Change Data Types: In one of the functions, convert text data to datetime or int, e.g., convert a text date to datetime in CalculateFuelConsumption.

Procedures (use transactions):
IdentifyInactiveVehicles: Retrieves vehicles that have not been on any trips.

AddNewRouteEntry: Adds a new route into the RoutesCatalog table.

UpdateVehicleDetails: Updates the information of an existing fleet vehicle.

Views:
Create a view to display all trip assignments along with vehicle details.

Create another view to display all available routes along with their drivers.

Triggers:
Create a trigger to automatically update the TripAssignments table when a new record is added to the RoutesCatalog table.

Create another trigger to log changes when a vehicle's information is updated in the FleetVehicles table.

ALTER Tasks:
Modify the RoutesCatalog table to add a new column for TravelTime.

Alter the CalculateFuelConsumption function to add new logic for layovers.

Alter constraints: e.g., change the OwnerContact column in FleetVehicles to be nullable.

DELETE Tasks:
Delete constraints: e.g., remove the unique constraint on the OwnerContact column in FleetVehicles.

Delete every table, function, procedure, trigger, etc., one by one to practice the deletion power in SQL Server.
