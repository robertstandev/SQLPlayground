Functions:

    GetAvailableCourses: Returns courses a student is not currently registered for.

    CalculateAttendanceRate: Calculates the attendance rate based on the number of classes attended.

    GetCoursesByInstructor: Returns courses taught by a specific instructor.

    GetRegisteredCourses: Returns courses a student is registered for.

    Use CASE: Incorporate a CASE statement in one of the functions, e.g., in CalculateAttendanceRate, use CASE to check the attendance percentage and apply different grading levels.

    Convert Data Types: In one of the functions, convert text data to datetime or int, e.g., convert a text date to datetime in CalculateAttendanceRate.

Procedures (use transactions):

    RetrieveAbsentLearners: Retrieves learners who have missed classes.

    AddNewCourse: Adds a new course into the Courses table.

    UpdateLearnerInfo: Updates the information of an existing learner.

Views:

    Create a view to show all registrations along with learner details.

    Create another view to show all available courses along with their instructors.

Triggers:

    Create a trigger to automatically update the Registrations table when a new record is added to the Courses table.

    Create another trigger to log changes when a learnerâ€™s information is updated in the Students table.

ALTER Tasks:

    Modify the Courses table to add a new column for RoomNumber.

    Alter the CalculateAttendanceRate function to add new logic for holiday periods.

    Alter constraints: e.g., change the ContactEmail column in Students to be nullable.

DELETE Tasks:

    Delete constraints: e.g., remove the unique constraint on the ContactEmail column in Students.
