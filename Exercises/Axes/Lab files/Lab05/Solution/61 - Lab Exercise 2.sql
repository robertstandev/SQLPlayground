-- Task 1

-- Write a SELECT statement to retrieve the custid and contactname columns from the Sales.Customers table and the orderid and orderdate columns from the Sales.Orders table. 
-- Filter the results to include only orders placed on or after April, 1 2008 (filter the orderdate column). 
-- Then sort the result by orderdate in descending order and custid in ascending order.
--
-- Execute the written statement and compare the results that you got with the desired results shown in the file 62 - Lab Exercise 2 - Task 1 Result.txt.

-- Task 2
-- 
-- Execute the query exactly as written inside a query window and observe the result.
--
-- You get an error. What is the error message? Why do you think you got this error? (Tip: Remember the logical processing order of the query.)
--Invalid column name 'mgrlastname'.
--There is no column in that table with that name ,'mgrlastname' is only an alias in the select
-- Apply the needed changes to the SELECT statement so that it will run without an error. Test the changes by executing the T-SQL statement.
--
-- Observe and compare the results that you got with the recommended result shown in the file 63 - Lab Exercise 2 - Task 2 Result.txt.
